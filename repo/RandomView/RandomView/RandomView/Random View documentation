RandomView is a Xamarin based application exhibiting MVVM/MVC pattern which runs on Android devices.
Users should be able to spawn an indefinite number of new views (squares or circles) filled with random colours or pattern images.

The project consists, Models which uses ViewProps which has all the properties of an View Object that appears random on the screen.

Under Utils, The CheckConnection class is used to check the internet connection.If connection is available,RandomShapAndSizeGenerator  class
fetches the Url from the Xml,downloads the image in BitMap using DownloadImage.cs, and randomly decides shape and size and sets the properties
finally under the Control SetViewProperties class.

This supports all types of devices and hence Screensize class handles the scenario.

ShakeDetector class is used to define the Shake Gesture detector.

Currently few images are pre loaded/downloaded,to avoid latency in hitting the url on request.In the next phase the images will be refreshed in 
background using background thread.

On double tap, the random view gets updated and is draggable too.
